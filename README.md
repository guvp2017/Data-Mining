## Data-Mining
#### Four data mining projects with resubmissions
Predict the popularity of a news article using the online news popularity dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (39,797 instances, 61 attributes). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used for feature selection during data preprocessing, different regression and classification models (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, random forest, decision tree learning, Gaussian NB, Gradient Boosting) are compared with model accuracy, parameters are optimized with GridSearchCV, and pipelines are constructed to combine PCA and KNN, RF or Gaussian NB classification method. Dimensionality reduction techniques (i.e. PCA, t-SNE) are used in different clustering models (e.g. K-Means, spectral, hierarchical) which were further evaluated with Silhouette Coefficient analysis.
